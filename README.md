Applying different filter to clean the images
1.Apply Averaging filter of image eye2_1 with
Uniform weights: [1 1 1; 1 1 1; 1 1 1]* (1/9) and
nonuniform weights: [1 2 1; 2 4 2; 1 2 1]* (1/16)
2. Show the Gaussian function
3. Apply Gaussian image filtering of image eye2_1
4. Apply Unsharp mask of image eye2_1
5. Remove noise of noise_bridge image using
  Gaussain filter
  Uniform filter
  Median filter
